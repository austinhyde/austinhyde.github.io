An [Ansible](http://docs.ansible.com/) module for installing [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) packages from the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/) via [packer](https://github.com/keenerd/packer).

I've been an Arch fan for quite a while now, and I always liked using packer to install AUR packages. Then I started playing with Ansible, and wanted an easy way to install AUR packages. Thus, ansible-packer was born.
