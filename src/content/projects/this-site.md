title: This Site

This site has been under "development" for a few years now, as I experimented with different frameworks and libraries and tools, made new opinions of things, and got sidetracked with other projects. [You know how that goes](https://i.imgur.com/WmEDOeP.jpg).

In the last few months though, I found the [Metalsmith](http://www.metalsmith.io/) static site generator, and, while it has its quirks, it fit the bill for what I was looking for out of an SSG - simple, keeps you in control, pluggable.

It didn't take long to get it figured out, mostly thanks to [Robin Thrift](http://www.robinthrift.com/posts/getting-to-know-metalsmith/). Mostly, the hard part was working out the gotchas of the various plugins, since most of them are relatively undocumented. I spent a good chunk of time source-diving these plugins, console logging, and trying to grok how [Robin Thrift's own site worked](https://github.com/RobinThrift/RobinThrift.com).
