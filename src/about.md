As you might have noticed already, my name is Austin Hyde, and this is my website.

I'm a software engineer, living and working in Pittsburgh, where I'm learning the hard way how to scale multi-faceted web services and the related intake, distribution, storage, and access of multi-sourced data.

As mentioned on the home page, I like making things, and taking them apart. Especially when it comes to software.
